# Cat vs Dog Image Classification (TensorFlow + CNN)

This project is a part of the **FreeCodeCamp** Machine Learning Certification â€” a binary image classification task to distinguish between cats and dogs using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

## About the Project

The goal of this project is to build an image classification model using TensorFlow and Keras that can accurately predict whether an image is of a **cat** or a **dog**.

### What I Did:

* Preprocessed the dataset using `ImageDataGenerator`
* Built a CNN model using TensorFlow/Keras
* Trained the model on a dataset of cat and dog images
* Evaluated the accuracy
* Visualized predictions using `plotImages` function

## Dataset

The dataset contains images of cats and dogs and was uploaded directly into Google Colab during training.

## Tools Used

* Python
* TensorFlow / Keras
* Google Colaboratory

## How to Use

To run this project:

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab.
2. Upload your dataset folders (`cats_and_dogs`) to the Colab session.
3. Run each cell in order.
4. At the end, the model will predict on 50 test images with a confidence score.

## Output Example

The output will show predictions like:

 >"100.00%  cat." or 
 >"100.00% dog."
